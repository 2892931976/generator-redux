## NOTE: This is incomplete, but I plan to have a basic version done in a week or so (July 22-24ish)

## Redux and Redux-devtools CLI

This is intended to be the successor to my existing [generator-flux](https://github.com/banderson/generator-flux-react) that was based on vanilla FB flux.

### Goals:

* Embrace all the hot-reloading goodness of Redux and Webpack Hot Reloader
* Minimal boilerplate, without sacrificing clarity
* Scaffold out initial app, and use to add new components/features throughout development cycle
